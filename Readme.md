# Brent's Magical Zoo
## overview
The goal was to build a zoo of animal to demonstrate the OOP principles of abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. This has no practical application.

## use
Currently, the application has no purpose or use case. If you wish to implement these classes in a zoological progect, you will need to grab all the classes to be certain you follow the complete inheritence tree.

## Architecture
This project is primarily in the form of an inheritence tree. All classes descend from the class of NonExist, then Living or Undead, etc.

## sources
Wikipedia confirmed some information about the source material and especially the publication dates.
